- [x] Movie details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.
- [x] When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched.

> **Reviewer comment:** In my perspective, you have done a perfect job implementing popular movie stage 1 and the format of your codes is extremely standard and your codes are easy to be understood. Great job for your popular movie stage 1! Hope to see your stage 2 codes soon! :)
